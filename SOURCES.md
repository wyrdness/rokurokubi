## Research Notes

The Rokurokubi represents an interesting intersection of several folkloric themes:

1. **Transformation Yokai**: Part of broader category of humans who transform or have supernatural abilities.

2. **Buddhist Morality Tales**: Often used to illustrate consequences of breaking Buddhist precepts.

3. **Hidden Identity**: Explores themes of secret lives and unknowable aspects of others (or oneself).

4. **Regional Variations**: The two types (Rokurokubi and Nukekubi) may represent regional or temporal variations of the same basic concept.

5. **Cultural Exchange**: Similarities to Southeast Asian creatures (Penanggalan, Manananggal) suggest possible cultural connections or parallel development.

6. **Modern Adaptation**: Remains popular in contemporary media, often portrayed more sympathetically as cursed individuals rather than purely malevolent beings.
