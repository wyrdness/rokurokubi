      "summary": "A Japanese yokai with an extending or detachable neck. Appears normal by day but at night either stretches their neck to great lengths (Rokurokubi) or detaches their head entirely (Nukekubi).",
      "full": "The Rokurokubi is a fascinating Japanese yokai that exists in two distinct forms. The classic Rokurokubi appears as a normal human during the day, but at night their neck extends to extraordinary lengths, allowing their head to move independently while their body remains stationary. The Nukekubi variant is even more dramatic—their head detaches completely from the body and flies around at night. Many Rokurokubi are unaware of their condition, believing their nighttime activities to be mere dreams. Others are fully conscious and may be malicious, using their abilities to spy on people, drink lamp oil, frighten sleepers, or even drink blood. The Nukekubi face a unique vulnerability: if their body is moved or hidden while their head is detached, they will die. This condition is often explained as a curse or punishment for sins, particularly Buddhist transgressions. The Rokurokubi appears frequently in Edo period folklore and continues to be popular in modern Japanese media."
